Nuclear energy is one of the lowest CO2 emitters. 
Additionally, it's low waste, ultra reliable, and safer than ever with next generation 
reactors and legacy plant upgrades. 
All credible models show that nuclear energy has an important role to play 
in global climate change mitigation efforts 
(e.g. IEA, 2021; BNEF, 2021; IIASA, 2021). 
The IPCC found that, on average, the pathways for the 1.5Â°C 
scenario require nuclear to reach 1160 gigawatts of electrical capacity by 2050, 
up from 394 gigawatts in 2020 (IPCC, 2018).
